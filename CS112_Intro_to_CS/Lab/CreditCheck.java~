/*
Develop a Java class  CreditCheck  that determines whether a customer has exceeded the credit limit on a charge account. Prompts the users for the following customer information: 
a) account number (type int)
b) balance at the beginning of the month (type double)
c) total of all items charged by the customer this month (type double)
d) total of all credits applied to the customer’s account this month (type double)
e) allowed credit limit. (type double)
After receiving these information, the program should calculate the new balance (= beginning balance + charges – credits), display the new balance and determine whether the new balance exceeds the customer’s credit limit. For those customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the program should display the message "Credit limit exceeded". 

Here are some sample outputs:

> java CreditCheck
Enter Account Number: 1001 
Enter Balance: 100 
Enter Charges: 80 
Enter Credits: 25 
Enter Credit Limit: 200 
New balance is 155.00 

> java CreditCheck
Enter Account Number:645
Enter Balance: 500 
Enter Charges: 300 
Enter Credits: 125 
Enter Credit Limit: 400 
New balance is 675 .00
Credit limit exceeded
