//Implement a class Point with 2 instance variables: x (int type) and y (int type). Next implement a constructor that takes 2 arguments to initialize the two instance variables when an object is created. Also, implement a zero-argument constructor that initializes both x and y to 0. After that implement a toString() method to print the class object.

//    Implement a class Rectangle with 2 instance variables: topleft (Point type), bottomrt (Point type). It also has 1 static variable count (int type) that is initialized to 0. Next, implement a constructor that takes two arguments of Point type to initialize the two instance variables. The constructor also adds 1 to count. After that, implement a getCount() method that returns the count and toString() method to print the class object. 

public class Point {
    private int x;
    private int y;
    private int age;
    public Point(int x, int y)
